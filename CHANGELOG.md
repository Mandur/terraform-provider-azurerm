## 2.0.0 (Unreleased)

NOTES:

* **Major Version:** Version 2.0 of the Azure Provider is a major version - some deprecated fields/resources have been removed - please [refer to the 2.0 upgrade guide for more information](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/guides/2.0-upgrade-guide.html).
* **Provider Block:** The Azure Provider now requires that a `features` block is specified within the Provider block, which can be used to alter the behaviour of certain resources - [more information on the `features` block can be found in the documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/providers/azurerm/index.html#features).
* **Terraform 0.10/0.11:** Version 2.0 of the Azure Provider no longer supports Terraform 0.10 or 0.11 - you must upgrade to Terraform 0.12 to use version 2.0 of the Azure Provider.

FEATURES:

* **Custom Timeouts:** - all resources within the Azure Provider now allow configuring custom timeouts - please [see Terraform's Timeout documentation](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/resources.html#operation-timeouts) and the documentation in each data source resource for more information.
* **Requires Import:** The Azure Provider now checks for the presence of an existing resource prior to creating it - which means that if you try and create a resource which already exists (without importing it) you'll be prompted to import this into the state.
* **New Resource:** `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine` [GH-5705]
* **New Resource:** `azurerm_linux_virtual_machine_scale_set` [GH-5705]
